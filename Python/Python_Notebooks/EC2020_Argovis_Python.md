This file contains a link to the Python Jupyter Notebook developed for the EarthCube 2020 meeting to demonstrate Argovis's API capabilities.  The Notebook is contained in a Docker so that users can easily run it as long as Docker is installed on their machine.  Here is the link:  https://github.com/earthcube2020/ec20_tucker_etal

This Jupyter notebook provides a set of functions for users to retrieve Argo float profiles, platforms, metadata, spatial-temporal selections, and gridded products (including weather events) stored on Argovis. Charts and simple calculations made by the output of these functions provide users the means to write their python scripts. We have bundled the required libraries into a Docker container so that users do not need to install python libraries manually. All software dependencies are installed in the Docker container and run the notebooks within the docker environment. Instructions on how to build and run the container are included.
