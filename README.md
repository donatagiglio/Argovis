You can try one of the examples, running one of the scripts that includes the word "example" in the file name.
Other scripts are functions that are needed to run the examples.
We are still working to provide a more detailed description for each script. Also, more scripts will be available in the future. PLEASE ASK US IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS! WE ARE HAPPY TO HELP!
